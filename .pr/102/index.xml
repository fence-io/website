We will explore:
What steps involved in the pod creation How containers communicate locally (Intra-Pod communication). Pod-to-Pod communication when the pods are on the same and different nodes. Pod-to-Service communication, where a pod sends traffic to another pod behind a service in Kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>Diving deep into Container Networking (An Exploration of Linux Network Namespace)</title><link>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/articles/networking/diving-deep-into-container-networking/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/articles/networking/diving-deep-into-container-networking/</guid><description>Introduction # Container networking might seem complex and almost mystical initially, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually built on basic Linux networking principles. By understanding these fundamentals, we can troubleshoot the container networking layers on a profound level. Furthermore, we might even create container networking solution from scratch for pure enjoyment.
In this article we are going to cover the foundational elements of container networking, from the underlying principles of network namespaces to the practical tools and techniques for managing container networking environments.</description></item><item><title>Validating Kubernetes resources offline - kubeconform review</title><link>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/articles/k8s-resources-validation/kubeconform-review/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/articles/k8s-resources-validation/kubeconform-review/</guid><description>In this article, we will explore kubeconform, the successor to kubeval.
Kubeconform is based on the same principles as kubeval, but it is actively maintained and has some unique features.
Introduction # As the two tools are very similar, I invite you to consult the article on kubeval which also applies to kubeconform.
Resource Schemas # Kubeconform uses JSON schemas to validate (or invalidate) the proposed resources. These JSON schemas are created from the OpenAPI schemas published within the Kubernetes GitHub repository.</description></item><item><title>Validating Kubernetes resources offline - kubeval review</title><link>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/articles/k8s-resources-validation/kubeval-review/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/articles/k8s-resources-validation/kubeval-review/</guid><description>In this article, we will discuss validating Kubernetes resource definitions using the tool kubeval.
Before we begin, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that kubeval is no longer maintained, and the author advises migrating to kubeconform. We will explore kubeconform in the next article.
Introduction # Validating Kubernetes resources is very useful for detecting non-compliant resources before applying them to a cluster. The most common use case is to perform validation during CI to validate (or invalidate) the quality of a pull request.</description></item><item><title>Setting up Load Balancer Service with Cilium in KinD Cluster</title><link>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/articles/networking/setting-up-load-balancer-service-with-cilium-in-kind-cluster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/articles/networking/setting-up-load-balancer-service-with-cilium-in-kind-cluster/</guid><description>Kubernetes in Docker (KinD) offers a lightweight and efficient way to run Kubernetes clusters for development and testing purposes. However, setting up KinD with load balancing option requires specific networking configurations. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the networking configuration of KinD on both Linux and MacOS, deep dive into load balancing options and discuss troubleshooting tactics.
Requirements # Docker KinD Kubectl Ciliumctl Setting Up Kubernetes in Docker # To create a KinD cluster with two nodes, you can use the following configuration:</description></item><item><title>Frontend adventures - Level 1</title><link>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/blog/posts/frontend-adventures/level-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/102/blog/posts/frontend-adventures/level-1/</guid><description>The first version of the homepage is up &amp;#x1f389;!
Current tools # mkdocs mkdocs-material theme took a lot of inspiration from the blowfish Hugo theme Mixed feeling # While this worked reasonably well for the homepage, my feeling is that it required a lot of custom code and I spent way too much time writing HTML and CSS. This is probably not what we want to do when adding content, but instead, work with Markdown as much as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
