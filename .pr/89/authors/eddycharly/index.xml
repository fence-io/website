Kubeconform is based on the same principles as kubeval, but it is actively maintained and has some unique features.
Introduction # As the two tools are very similar, I invite you to consult the article on kubeval which also applies to kubeconform.
Resource Schemas # Kubeconform uses JSON schemas to validate (or invalidate) the proposed resources. These JSON schemas are created from the OpenAPI schemas published within the Kubernetes GitHub repository.</description></item><item><title>Validating Kubernetes resources offline - kubeval review</title><link>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/89/articles/k8s-resources-validation/kubeval/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/89/articles/k8s-resources-validation/kubeval/</guid><description>In this article, we will discuss validating Kubernetes resource definitions using the tool kubeval.
Before we begin, it&amp;rsquo;s important to note that kubeval is no longer maintained, and the author advises migrating to kubeconform. We will explore kubeconform in the next article.
Introduction # Validating Kubernetes resources is very useful for detecting non-compliant resources before applying them to a cluster. The most common use case is to perform validation during CI to validate (or invalidate) the quality of a pull request.</description></item><item><title>Frontend adventures - Level 1</title><link>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/89/blog/posts/frontend-adventures/level-1/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://fence-io.github.io/website/.pr/89/blog/posts/frontend-adventures/level-1/</guid><description>The first version of the homepage is up &amp;#x1f389;!
Current tools # mkdocs mkdocs-material theme took a lot of inspiration from the blowfish Hugo theme Mixed feeling # While this worked reasonably well for the homepage, my feeling is that it required a lot of custom code and I spent way too much time writing HTML and CSS. This is probably not what we want to do when adding content, but instead, work with Markdown as much as possible.</description></item></channel></rss>
