# Frontend adventures - Take 1

First version of the homepage is up!

Current tools are:

- mkdocs
- mkdocs-material theme
- took a lot of inspiration from the blowfish Hugo theme

While this worked reasonably well for the homepage, my feeling is that it required a lot of custom code and i spent way too much time writing HTML and CSS.
This is probably not what we want to do when adding content, but instead work with Markdown as much as possible.

At this point, I wonder if Hugo would have been a better choice, mkdocs is heavily focused on documentation websites, which is not the purpose of what we are trying to build.
